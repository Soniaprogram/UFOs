# UFOs


## Overview of Project:

The purpose of this analysis is to use javascript and HTML to display UFO sighting data as a table and allow for users to filter through this data for multiple criteria. I built a table using data stored in a Javascript array. I also created filters through user input and then placed the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. The table filters for the date, city, state, country, and shape. 

#### Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria

The webpage appears as this:

## Results:

To perform a search, you would go to the Filter Search section on the left and type in a date, city, state, country, and/or shape. The data will filter according to the inputted values. You could enter an input for all 5 fields or any of them in no particular order. 

For example: You could input the following into Filter Search:  
- Enter Date: 1/1/2010
- Enter City: el cajon
- Enter State: ca
- Enter Country: us
- Enter Shape: triangle

This would output 2 results as seen below:

## Summary:

One drawback of this new design is that we are limited to the search fields provided (date, city, state, and shape) and cannot search for any other fields. 
I would recommend adding in a section for images of these UFO sightings for more evidence as well as how many people witnessed this sighting. I would also recommend adding in the ability to filter by duration and a search bar to match keywords in the comments section in case a user is looking for a specific sighting.
